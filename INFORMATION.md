# C Registration System

## Description

A repository designed, in C, to simulate a system within a registrar's office. The system is designed to allow for an employee to add students and courses to the admission database. In addition, the system enables the user to enroll registered students into registered courses; users can also drop students from courses. Lastly, the system is capable of displaying the enrollment table for reference.

## Contents

- [x] `main.c`: Program execution through main function

## Usage

The repository is openly available to whomever wishes to clone and improve upon it. I would kindly ask if you could submit pull requests for your improvements so that everyone can access such enhancements.
